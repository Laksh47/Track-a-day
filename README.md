# Track-a-day
A simple pet project that will help mobile users to make note of what's happening around. Moving forward, this project aims to become an electronic diary for mobile users.


So far, a working prototype that allows users to add and delete text content has been built. This project follows material design standards in android.
This prototype has a navigation drawer(Android UI element) for the user to move between add and delete pages(intents).
